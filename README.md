# SQL Queries and Descriptive Statistical Analysis with CMS Medicare Data

* **Purpose** 
  - I developed this project to showcase foundational knowledge of Structured Query Language (SQL) concepts with US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare data. 
 
* **Overview** 
  - Structured Query Language (SQL) is an object-oriented programming language that has high utility for data storage, manipulation, and retrieval in databases. Research in Real World Evidence (RWE) routinely consists of queries and transformations of large data sets.
